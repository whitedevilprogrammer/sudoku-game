Know the rules
Sudoku is a puzzle based on a small number of very simple rules:
 
1)Every square has to contain a single number
2)Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be used
3)Each 3×3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
4)Each vertical column can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
5)Each horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
6)Once the puzzle is solved, this means that every row, column, and 3×3 box will contain every number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
